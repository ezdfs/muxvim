# What is this project?

This project is a lightweight, opinionated Neovim configuration and helper setup designed to make Neovim comfortable and productive on mobile devices (phones and tablets). It bundles sensible defaults, UI tweaks, and plugins (in Lua) that prioritize 
small screens, touch and virtual-keyboard workflows, and performance-constrained environments so you can edit code and text smoothly on Termux.

- **Purpose**: Provide a ready-to-use Neovim configuration tuned for mobile workflows so you don’t have to rework a desktop config for small screens.
- **Focus**: small-screen layout, simplified mappings, minimal but useful plugins, startup/performance optimizations, and optional integrations for common mobile shells.
- **Contents (typical)**: Lua-based init/config files, plugin list and manager setup, keybindings and touch-friendly mappings, tips for installing on Termux.
